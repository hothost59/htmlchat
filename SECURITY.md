## Reporting a Vulnerability

DM me on Discord at @hothost. (the period is important)

## Known Security Bugs

- All database information is readable and writable.
  For this reason, do not put in important passwords and data.
- Passwords are not hashed.
  Again, do not put in reused and important passwords.
- No automod
  This is not really a security bug, but it is nice to note.

## Policy on Taking Notice of Security Bugs

- I will note all reported security bugs once I see and respond to your Discord message.
